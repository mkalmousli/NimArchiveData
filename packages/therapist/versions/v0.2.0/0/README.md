Therapist_ - for when commands and arguments are getting you down
=================================================================

A simple to use, declarative, type-safe command line parser, with beautiful help messages and clear
errors, suitable for simple scripts and complex tools.

Therapist allows you to use a carefully constructed ``tuple`` to specify how you want your commandline 
arguments to be parsed. Each value in the tuple must be set to a ``<Type>Arg`` of the appropriate type, which
specifies how that argument will appear, what values it can take and provides a help string for the user.

A simple 'Hello world' example:

.. code-block:: nim

    import therapist

    # The parser is specified as a tuple
    let spec = (
        # Name is a positional argument, by virtue of being surrounded by < and >
        name: newStringArg(@["<name>"], help="Person to greet"),
        # --times is an optional argument, by virtue of starting with - and/or --
        times: newIntArg(@["-t", "--times"], defaultVal=1, help="How many times to greet"),
        # --version will cause 0.1.0 to be printed
        version: newMessageArg(@["--version"], "0.1.0", help="Prints version"),
        # --help will cause a help message to be printed
        help: newHelpArg(@["-h", "--help"], help="Show help message"),
    )
    # `args` and `command` would normally be picked up from the commandline
    spec.parseOrQuit(prolog="Greeter", args="-t 2 World", command="hello")
    # If a help message or version was requested or a parse error generated it would be printed
    # and then the parser would call `quit`. Getting past `parseOrQuit` implies we're ok.
    for i in 1..spec.times.value:
        echo "Hello " & spec.name.value

    doAssert spec.name.seen
    doAssert spec.name.value == "World"
    doAssert spec.times.seen
    doAssert spec.times.value == 2


The above parser generates the following help message

.. code-block:: sh

    Greeter

    Usage:
      hello <name>
      hello --version
      hello -h|--help

    Arguments:
      <name>               Person to greet

    Options:
      -t, --times=<times>  How many times to greet [default: 1]
      --version            Prints version
      -h, --help           Show help message

The constructor for each ``<Type>Arg`` type takes the form:

.. code-block:: nim

  # doctest: skip
  proc newStringArg*(variants: seq[string], help: string, defaultVal="", choices=newSeq[string](),
                      helpvar="", required=false, optional=false, multi=false, env="", helpLevel=0)

- Every argument must be declared with one or more ``variants``. There are three types of argument:
   * Positional Arguments are declared in ``variants`` as ``<value>`` whose value is determined by 
     the order of arguments provided. They are required unless ``optional=true``
   * Optional Arguments are declared in ``variants`` as ``-o`` (short form) or ``--option`` (long form)
     which may take an argument or simply be counted. They are optional unless ``required=true``
   * Commands (declared in variants as ``command``) are expected to be entered by the user as written.
     The remainder of the arguments are parsed by a subparser which may have a different specification
     to the main parser
- Options may be interleaved with arguments, so ``> markup input.txt -o output.html`` is the same as
  ``> markup -o output.html input.txt``
- Options that take a value derive from ``ValueArg`` and may be entered as ``-o <value>``, ``-o:<value>`` 
  or ``-o=<value>`` (similarly for the long form i.e. ``--option <value>`` etc). Short options that
  do not take a value may be repeated, e.g. ``-vvv`` and short options can take values without a 
  separator e.g. ``-o<value>``
- A ``CountArg`` is a special type of ``Arg`` that counts how many times it is seen, without taking a 
  value (sometimes called a flag).
- ``CountArg`` also allows some special variant formats. If you specify ``--[no]option``, then 
  ``--option`` will count upwards (``args.count>0``) and ``--nooption`` will count downwards 
  (``args.count<0``). Alternatively ``-y/-n`` or ``--yes/--no`` will count upwards for ``-y`` or
  ``--yes`` and downwards for ``-n`` or ``--no``. Note that ``args.seen`` will return ``true`` if 
  ``args.count!=0``.
- If a command is seen, parsing will switch to that command immediately. So in ``> pal --verbose push --force``,
  the base parser receives ``--verbose``, and the ``push`` command parser receives ``--force``
- If an argument has been seen ``arg.seen`` will return ``true``. The values will also be entered
  into a ``values`` ``seq``, with the most recently seen value stored in ``value``. The number of 
  times the argument has been seen can be found in ``arg.count``
- If ``--`` is seen, the remainder of the arguments will be taken to be positional arguments, even
  if they look like options or commands
- A ``defaultVal`` value may be provided in case the argument is not seen. Additionally an ``env`` 
  key can be provided (e.g. `env=USER`). If ``env`` is set to a key that is set in the environment, 
  the default value will be set to that value
  e.g. ``$USER``).
- Arguments are expected to be seen at most once, unless ``multi=true``
- If there are only a set number of acceptable values for an argument, they can be listed in
  ``choices``
- A ``helpvar`` may be provided for use in the autogenerated help (e.g. ``helpvar="n"`` would lead 
  to a help message saying ``--number=<n>``)
- Within the help message, arguments are usually grouped into ``Commands``, ``Arguments`` and 
  ``Options``. If you want to group them differently, use the ``group`` parameter to define new 
  groups. Groups and arguments will be shown the order that they are appear in the tuple definition.
- If ``helpLevel`` is set to a value ``x`` greater than 0 the argument will only be shown in a help 
  message if the ``HelpArg`` is defined ``showLevel`` set to a value greater than or equal to ``x``
- If you want to define a new ``ValueArg`` type ``defineArg`` is a template that will fill in the
  boilerplate for you

Argument types provided out of the box
--------------------------------------

- ``ValueArg`` - base class for arguments that take a value
   * ``StringArg`` - expects a string
   * ``IntArg`` - expects an integer
   * ``FloatArg`` - expects a floating point number
   * ``BoolArg`` - expects a boolean (on/off, true/false)
   * ``FileArg`` - expects a string argument that must point to an existing file
   * ``DirArg`` - expects a string argument that must point to an existing directory
   * ``PathArg`` - expects a string that must point to an existing file or directory
- ``CountArg`` - expects no value, simply counts how many times the argument is seen
- ``HelpArg`` - if seen, prints an auto-generated help message
- ``MessageArg`` - if seen, prints a message (e.g. version number)

Creating your own argument type
-------------------------------

Creating your own ``ValueArg`` is as simple as defining a ``parse`` method that turns a ``string`` 
into a value of an appropriate type (or raises a ``ValueError`` for invalid input). Suppose we want 
to create a ``DateArg`` type that only accepts ISO-formatted dates:

.. code-block:: nim

    import therapist
    import times

    let DEFAULT_DATE = initDateTime(1, mJan, 2000, 0, 0, 0, 0)
    proc parseDate(value: string): DateTime = parse(value, "YYYY-MM-dd")
    defineArg[DateTime](DateArg, newDateArg, "date", parseDate, DEFAULT_DATE)

Now we can call ``newDateArg`` to ask the user to supply a date

Examples
--------

At the other extreme, you can create complex parsers with subcommands (the example below may be 
familiar to those who have seen `docopt.nim`_). Note that the help message is slightly different; 
this is in part because parser itself is stricter. For example, ``--moored`` is only valid inside 
the ``mine`` subcommand, and as such, will only appear in the help for that command, shown if you
run ``navel_fate mine --help``.

.. code-block:: nim

   import options
   import strutils
   import therapist

   let prolog = "Navel Fate."
        
   let create = (
         name: newStringArg(@["<name>"], multi=true, help="Name of new ship")
   )
   let move = (
         name: newStringArg(@["<name>"], help="Name of ship to move"),
         x: newIntArg(@["<x>"], help="x grid reference"),
         y: newIntArg(@["<y>"], help="y grid reference"),
         speed: newIntArg(@["--speed"], defaultVal=10, help="Speed in knots"),
         help: newHelpArg()
   )
   let shoot = (
         x: newIntArg(@["<x>"], help="Name of new ship"),
         y: newIntArg(@["<y>"], help="Name of new ship"),
         help: newHelpArg()
   )
   let state = (
         moored: newCountArg(@["--moored"], help="Moored (anchored) mine"),
         drifting: newCountArg(@["--drifting"], help="Drifting mine"),
   )
   let mine = (
         action: newStringArg(@["<action>"], choices = @["set", "remove"], help="Action to perform"),
         x: newIntArg(@["<x>"], help="Name of new ship"),
         y: newIntArg(@["<y>"], help="Name of new ship"),
         state: state,
         help: newHelpArg()
   )
   let ship = (
         create: newCommandArg(@["new"], create, help="Create a new ship"),
         move: newCommandArg(@["move"], move, help="Move a ship"),
         shoot: newCommandArg(@["shoot"], shoot, help="Shoot at another ship"),
         help: newHelpArg()
   )
   let spec = (
         ship: newCommandArg(@["ship"], ship, help="Ship commands"),
         mine: newCommandArg(@["mine"], mine, help="Mine commands"),
         help: newHelpArg()
   )

   let (success, message) = spec.parseOrMessage(prolog="Navel Fate.", args="--help", command="navel_fate")

   let expected = """
   Navel Fate.

   Usage:
     navel_fate ship new <name>...
     navel_fate ship move <name> <x> <y>
     navel_fate ship shoot <x> <y>
     navel_fate mine (set|remove) <x> <y>
     navel_fate -h|--help

   Commands:
     ship        Ship commands
     mine        Mine commands

   Options:
     -h, --help  Show help message""".strip()

   doAssert success and message.isSome
   doAssert message.get == expected


Many more examples are available in the source code and in the nimdoc_ for the various functions.

Possible features therapist does not have
-----------------------------------------

In *rough* order of likelihood of being added:

- Options for help format from columns (current) to paragraphs
- Ints and floats being limited to a range rather than a set of discrete values
- Support for ``+w`` and ``-w`` to equate to ``w=true`` and ``w=false``
- Integration with ``bash`` / ``fish`` completion scripts
- Dependent option requirements i.e. because ``--optionA`` appears, ``--optionB`` is required, or one of 
  ``--left`` or ``--right`` is required
- Case/style insensitive matching
- Partial matches for ``commands`` i.e. ``pal pus`` is the same as ``pal push``, if that is the 
  only unambiguous match
- Support for alternate option characters (e.g. /) or different option semantics (e.g. java-style 
  single `-` ``-option``)

Alternatives and prior art
--------------------------

This is therapist. There are many argument parsers like it, but this one is mine. Which one you 
prefer is likely a matter of taste. If you want to explore alternatives, you might like to look at:

- parseopt_ - for if you like to parse your args as they are flung at you, old school style
- `nim-argparse`_ - looks nice, but heavy use of macros, which makes it a little too magic for me
- `docopt.nim`_ - you get to craft your help message, but how you use the results (and indeed what
  the spec actually means) has always felt inscrutable to me
- cligen_ - *the* fastest way to generate a commandline parser if you already have the function you 
  want (think argh_ from python for nim). More complex use cases look a bit less elegant to my eyes, 
  but you're still going to be winning the code golf competition
