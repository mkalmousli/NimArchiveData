# nim-yottadb
**Nim Language implementation for the YottaDB database**

This project adds 'Nim' (https://nim-lang.org) as another language to access YottaDB NoSQL database. (https://yottadb.com)

YottaDB is a proven Multi-Language NoSQL database engine whose code base has decades of maturity and continuous investment. It is currently in production at some of the largest real-time core banking applications and electronic health record deployments.

For latest changes see the [CHANGELOG](doc/CHANGELOG.md)

The nim-yottadb implementation delievers the following features:
### Simple-API ###
- ydb_data (Get the state of a node or tree)
- ydb_delete (Node or Tree)
- ydb_delete_excl (Delete local variables except ...)
- ydb_get (Get a local or global variable)
- ydb_incr (Atomic Increment a local or global variable)
- ydb_lock (Lock 1 or more global variables)
- ydb_lock_incr / ydb_lock_dec (Increment or decrement a lock count)
- ydb_node_next (Get the next node of a global)
- ydb_node_previous (Like next, but other direction)
- ydb_set (Set the value of a local or global variable)
- ydb_subscript_next (Traverse the subscript tree of a Global). Up to 32 subscripts are allowed
- ydb_subscript_previous (Like ydb_subscript_next, but other direction)
- ydb_tp (Start a transaction)
- ydb_ci (Call a M-Routine via Call-In Interface)
- ydb_zwr2str / ydb_zwr2str Convert bindary data and convert back

### Extensions to the Simple-API
- Support for binary data > 1MB
- Iterator for next/previous node
- Iterator for next/previous subscript
- YdbVar with $ and [] operator
```nim
for i in 0..MAX:
    var v = newYdbVar("^Geo", @["LAND", "ORT", i])
    # update db with new value
    v[] = "New " & v.value
```
### DSL
The DSL allows to write programs with globals in very natural way.
```nim
  withlock(4711):
    let id = @["4711", "Acc123"]
    var amount = get: ^account(id).float
    amount += 1500.0
    setvar ^account(id) = amount # update db
  echo "Done"
  # lock automatically released here
```
To set an id for a global some different variants are available
```nim
setvar:
  ^gbl(1)=1
  ^gbl(1,1)=1.1
  ^gbl("B")="..."
  ^gbl("B","C")="..."
  let (id1, id2, id3) = (4711, "CSTM", 1.0)
  ^gbl(id1, id2, id3) = "....."
  let subs: Subscripts = @["ACCNT", "4711", "1.1"]
  ^gbl(subs)="...."
```

### Currently the following DSL is supported:
- ### setvar: 
```nim
setvar: ^Customer(4711,"Name")="John Doe"
```
- increment:
```nim
let: int txid = increment ^CNT("TXID") # +1
let: int csid = increment ^CNT("CSID", by=5) # +5
```
- ### get / getblob
```nim
let name = get: ^Customer(4711,"Name")
let f: float = get: ^Customer(4711, accountId, transactionId, "amount").float
let image = getblob(^images("folderA", 815))
```
- ### nextnode:
```nim 
  rc: int
  node: Subscripts
(rc, node) = nextnode: ^House("FLOOR")
```
- ### prevnode:
```nim
(rc, node) = prevnode: ^House("FLOOR", "9999")
```
- ### nextsubscript:
```nim
(rc, node) = nextsubscript: ^House("ELECTRIC")
```
- ### prevsubscript:
```nim
(rc, node) = prevsubscript: ^House("ELECTIRC", "CABLES")
```
- ### data:
```nim
let dta: int = data: ^House("FLOOR")
'dta' can have the following values:
enum YdbData:
YDB_DATA_UNDEF = 0, # Node is undefined
YDB_DATA_VALUE_NODESC = 1, # Node has a value but no descendants
YDB_DATA_NOVALUE_DESC = 10, # Node has no value but has descendants
YDB_DATA_VALUE_DESC = 11 # # Node has both value and descendants
```
- ### delnode:
```nim
delnode: ^House("FLOOR",1)
```
- ### deltree:
```nim
deltree: ^House("FLOOR")
```
- ### delexcl:
```nim
delexcl: { DELTEST1, DELTEST3, DELTEST5 }
```
- ### lock:
```nim
lock: { ^House("FLOOR", 11), ^House("FLOOR", 12) }
lock: { lclvar, ^House("FLOOR"), timeout=1000000 }
lock +^gblvar
lock -lclvar
```

All API-Calls are available in a single- or multi-threaded version and ara automatically selected via the **when compileOption("threads")**

### No Maximum Record size
The YottaDB limit of 1MB for record size is no longer in effect. nim-yottadb handles larger record sizes up to 99_999_999 MB. The size is only limited due to memory constraints.
In the future there will be a `stream-interface`to handle virtual unlimited record sizes.

Records larger than 1 MB are split into subrecords. To do this, an additional key index is appended to the keys, incrementing from 0 to a maximum of 99999999, with each record containing 1 MB of data.

```nim
"___$00000000$___"
```
When reading back with `getblob`, nim-yottadb automatically checks whether such index keys exist and loads the data accordingly.
The processing of strings and binary data is also automatic.

### Sample to load / restore images into YottaDb
```nim
import os
import std/[times, strutils]
import yottadb

proc walk(path: string): seq[string] =
    for kind, path in walkDir(path):
        case kind:
        of pcFile, pcLinkToFile:
            result.add(path)
        of pcDir, pcLinkToDir:
            result.add(walk(path))

proc loadImagesToDb(basedir: string) =
    for image in walk(basedir):
        let image_number = increment(^CNT("image_number"))
        setvar:
            ^images($image_number) = readFile(image)
            ^images($image_number, "path") = image
            ^images($image_number, "created") = now()

proc saveImage(target: string, path: string, img: string) =
    if not dirExists(target):
        createDir(target)

    let filename = path.split("/")[^1]
    let fullpath = target & "/" & filename
    writeFile(fullpath, img)

proc readImagesFromDb(target: string) =
    var (rc, subs) = nextsubscript: ^images(@[""]) # -> @["223"], @["224"], ...
    while rc == YDB_OK:
        let img     = getblob(^images(subs))
        let path    = get(^images(subs, "path"))
        saveImage(target, path, img)
        (rc, subs) = nextsubscript: ^images(subs)

if isMainModule:
    loadImagesToDb("./images") # read from the folder and save in db
    readImagesFromDb("./images_fromdb") # read from db and save under this folder
```

This project was started to learn NIM (https://nim-lang.org)
I'm truly impressed by the simplicity, power, and flexibility of Nim. The possibilities offered by macros and templates, in particular, make Nim a powerful tool. Developing software is finally fun again.
