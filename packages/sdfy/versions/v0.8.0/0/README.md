# SDFY - Fast 2D Vector Shapes *with* Shadows for GUIs and Images using SDFs

![All Shapes Example](data/all_shapes_grid.png)

A high-performance library implementing 2D signed distance functions (SDFs) with multiple rendering modes and SIMD optimizations. Implemented with Nim but compatible with C/C++. Drop a note if you'd like a C API.

These SDFs are targeted and tune for quickly making drop shadows for GUIs. These can be used with graphical renderers to speed up expensive drop and inset shadows.

## Features

- **Fast SDF Implementation**: Optimized implementations of common 2D shapes
- **Multiple Rendering Modes**: Support for various anti-aliasing and effect techniques
- **SIMD Acceleration**: Leverages SIMD (SSE2/NEON) instructions for maximum CPU performance
- **Pixie Integration**: Seamless integration with the Pixie graphics library
- **Flexible API**: Easy-to-use interface for rendering SDFs to images

## How It Works

Creating good looking drop and inset shadows is traditionally done using Gaussian Blur. This requires a 2D convolution which is slow even if done in X and then Y directions.

It's also a bit wasteful since we know the vector shape for most basic GUI elements. Why can't we use that to reduce the computational overhead?

That's where SDFs come in. They allow efficiently getting the nearest distance to a shape for any point and whether it's inside or outside the shape. We can then take this value (a linear gradient) and apply a 1D gaussian function to it.

From this we get a good looking, if not perfect, drop shadow! There's a slight difference it seems between the SDF + Gaussian 1D function vs a 2D true Gaussian blur on corners.

## Supported Shapes

- **Rounded Rectangle**: Fully configurable rounded rectangles with independent corner radii
- **Chamfer Box**: Rectangles with chamfered (cut) corners
- **Circle**: Perfect circles with configurable radius
- **Box**: Simple rectangles/boxes with sharp corners
- **Ellipse**: Elliptical shapes with configurable semi-axes
- **Quadratic Bézier Curve**: Smooth curves defined by three control points
- **Arc**: Circular arc segments with configurable aperture and thickness
- **Parallelogram**: Four-sided shapes with parallel opposite sides and configurable skew
- **Pie**: Pie slice/sector shapes with configurable aperture and radius
- **Ring**: Ring/annular segments with configurable aperture, radius, and thickness

## Rendering Modes

- **Clip**: Sharp edges without anti-aliasing
- **Clip AA**: Sharp edges with anti-aliasing  
- **Annular**: Creates ring/annular shapes
- **Annular AA**: Anti-aliased ring shapes
- **Feather**: Standard anti-aliased edges with customizable factor
- **Feather Inverse**: Inverted feather anti-aliasing
- **Feather Gaussian**: Gaussian-based anti-aliasing for smooth edges
- **Drop Shadow**: Gaussian-based drop shadow effects
- **Inset Shadow**: Inner shadow effects
- **Inset Shadow Annular**: Annular inner shadow effects

## Performance

| Mode | With SIMD | Without SIMD | Speedup |
|------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Pixie Shadow** | **456 ms** | **476 ms** | **1.0x** |
| Clip | 5 ms | 20 ms | 4.0x |
| Clip AA | 6 ms | 30 ms | 5.0x |
| Annular | 5 ms | 22 ms | 4.4x |
| Annular AA | 6 ms | 33 ms | 5.5x |
| Feather | 6 ms | 23 ms | 3.8x |
| Feather Inverse | 6 ms | 26 ms | 4.3x |
| Feather Gaussian | 7 ms | 24 ms | 3.4x |
| Drop Shadow | 7 ms | 24 ms | 3.4x |
| Inset Shadow | 8 ms | 24 ms | 3.0x |
| Inset Shadow Annular | 7 ms | 24 ms | 3.4x |

*Performance measured on rounded rectangles (300x300 image). SIMD provides 3-5x performance improvement. **SDF functions are 15-65x faster than traditional Pixie rendering with shadows.***

**Shape-specific Performance:**
- **Simple shapes** (Circle, Box): Fastest rendering, full SIMD optimization
- **Medium complexity** (Rounded Box, Chamfer Box, Arc, Pie, Ring): Good SIMD optimization
- **Complex shapes** (Ellipse, Bézier, Parallelogram): Partial SIMD optimization with scalar fallbacks for complex math

## Image Compatibility

SDFY is designed to work with multiple image types through a flexible generic interface. You can use:

- **Pixie Image**: The standard `pixie.Image` type from the Pixie graphics library
- **SdfImage**: The included `SdfImage` type for lightweight image operations
- **Custom Image Types**: Any type that implements the required interface

### Required Image Interface

For an image type to work with SDFY's `drawSdfShape` function, it must provide:

```nim
# Required fields/properties:
image.width: int       # Image width in pixels
image.height: int      # Image height in pixels
image.data: seq[ColorRGBX]  # Pixel data as RGBX color sequence

# Required function/template:
image.dataIndex(x, y: int): int  # Calculate array index for pixel at (x, y)
```

### Implementation Example

```nim
type
  CustomImage* = object
    width*, height*: int
    data*: seq[ColorRGBX]

# Implement the dataIndex template
template dataIndex*(image: CustomImage, x, y: int): int =
  image.width * y + x

# Now you can use it with SDFY
let myImage = CustomImage(width: 300, height: 300)
myImage.data = newSeq[ColorRGBX](300 * 300)

drawSdfShape(
  myImage,  # Works with any compatible image type
  center = vec2(150, 150),
  wh = vec2(200, 200),
  params = CircleParams(r: 100.0),
  pos = rgba(255, 100, 100, 255),
  neg = rgba(50, 50, 50, 255),
  mode = sdfModeFeatherInv
)
```

### SdfImage vs Pixie type for Image

SDFY includes an image type equivalent to Pixie's `Image` type for compatability with Pixie.

## Examples

### Basic Rounded Rectangle

```nim
import pixie, sdfy

let image = newImage(300, 300)
drawSdfShape(
  image,
  center = vec2(150, 150),
  wh = vec2(200, 200),
  params = RoundedBoxParams(r: vec4(20, 20, 20, 20)),  # 20px radius on all corners
  pos = rgba(255, 100, 100, 255),
  neg = rgba(50, 50, 50, 255),
  mode = sdfModeFeatherInv
)
```

### Asymmetric Corners

```nim
# Different radius for each corner
let corners = vec4(
  0.0,   # top-right: sharp corner
  20.0,  # bottom-right: small radius
  40.0,  # bottom-left: medium radius  
  80.0   # top-left: large radius
)

drawSdfShape(
  image,
  center = center,
  wh = size,
  params = RoundedBoxParams(r: corners),
  pos = fill,
  neg = bg,
  mode = sdfModeFeatherInv
)
```

### Drop Shadow Effect

```nim
drawSdfShape(
  image,
  center = vec2(150, 150),
  wh = vec2(200, 200),
  params = RoundedBoxParams(r: vec4(20, 20, 20, 20)),
  pos = rgba(255, 255, 255, 255),
  neg = rgba(0, 0, 0, 0),
  factor = 10.0,
  spread = 20.0,
  mode = sdfModeDropShadow
)
```

## MSDF (Multi-channel Signed Distance Fields)

SDFY includes an MSDF generator for fonts and SVG paths plus helpers to render MSDF bitmaps based on [MSDFGen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen). This is based on Valve's original SDF bitmap field fonts for OpenGL.

Use `generateMsdfGlyph` / `generateMsdfPath` from `sdfy/msdfgen`, then render with
`renderMsdf`, `blitMsdfGlyph`, or `drawSdfShape` via `MsdfBitmapParams`.

### Sample Font Output

This works, but as you can see isn't super high quality for small fonts. You would probably need to user super-sampling to get this to work well:

![MSDF Sample Font Output](tests/expected/msdf_alnum_draw_32_white.png)

### Star Icon (SVG Path)

For generic SVG paths, MSDF works rather well and scales very nicely.

Note the shadow artifacts - the normal SDFModes for drop shadow and gaussian feathers don't work well with MSDF fields. It might be a matter of tweaking.

This star is generated at 32x32 and scales up to 512x512 nicely:

Here's an example rendered output:
