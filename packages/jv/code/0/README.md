# Execute a compiled program
jv execute App

# List installed Java versions
jv manage list

# Install a new Java version
jv manage install openjdk@1.17.0

jv manage set openjdk@1.17.0

# Install version manager (if needed)
jv manage setup
```

### Project Initialization

The `init` command sets up a new Java project with:

- Gradle build system using Kotlin DSL
- Standard Maven project structure
- JUnit 5 testing support
- Package name based on reversed domain (e.g., com.example becomes example.com)
- Sample App class and test

```sh
jv init
# Enter your domain when prompted
