Kirpi aims to be an elegant framework for the Nim language, enabling you to create 2D **creative coding** projects or awesome **2D games**. The graphics approach is inspired by [Löve2D](https://love2d.org/) (LÖVE2D users will feel right at home).

Currently, it uses Naylib (the most maintained and crowded Nim wrapper for Raylib) as its backend. Consequently, it can target **Web/WASM,Linux, Windows, macOS, and Android**. In the future, new backends might be added or existing ones might change; however, the Kirpi API you write today shall remain the same. Your applications and modules will continue to function thanks to this flexible and pragmatic approach.



## Why kirpi?
* **Minimal API:** Kirpi features a carefully curated and purposeful abstraction. While it allows you to do a lot, there is very little you actually need to learn. With basic programming knowledge and a quick glance at the Nim docs, you can jump right in.
* **A Great (or Aspiring to be Great) 2D Graphics API:** It covers almost every option found in vector software, except for boolean operations (which you can implement as an independent module). Visualizing your code is both fun and takes only seconds. Plus, it aims to do this while providing options for maximum performance.
* **Built for Building Modules and Tools:** Kirpi was designed as a core API that is fun to use standalone, as a concept of how 2D development could be better. However, it also aims to stay out of your way if you want to do more. Can you develop external modules for things missing in Kirpi? We actually encourage it—go ahead. Is Kirpi blocking you from doing so? Open an issue and let’s discuss it.
* **Very small Web builds for a WASM-based runtime:** Performance-first builds of an empty project ship at ~750 KB uncompressed and ~350 KB zipped, comparable to many JavaScript game frameworks. It also features a well-written JavaScript bridge for adapting SDKs and plugins.
* **Solid Support on Supported Platforms:** There is a project template with configurations that handle most of the heavy lifting for Android and other platforms. Improvements regarding platform configurations happen directly within the project template repository.
* **Survival and Backward Compatibility:** Kirpi decouples its API and workflow from the backend. By keeping the API consistent while remaining pragmatic about the backend, it ensures that games and tools developed with Kirpi remain functional and portable for years. If a backend issue arises, it's easy to fix or swap.

## Why Nim?
* Write your games and modules elegantly, as if using a scripting language, but get C-like performance. With Nim’s ARC/ORC memory management—similar to C++'s RAII but more modern—you don't just get massive performance; you also don't have to worry about memory safety most of the time. No need to write logic in a script and extensions in C/C++ for performance. Just sit down and write everything in one language: Nim.

* Get incredibly small binaries on almost every platform.

* Benefit from a mature standard library that answers most of your needs.

* Nim is a general-purpose language that can target C, C++, JS, and Objective-C, making it useful far beyond just game development.

## There are Great Game Engines Out There Today
I completely agree. As the creator of this project, I also prefer popular engines for projects where the scale and requirements demand it. However, after over 10 years of game development, I can tell you this: Hey friend, most 2D games don't actually need more than a framework like this and a few simple modules. You don't need to fight giant physics engine APIs just to make a simple platformer. You don't need to carry the weight of scripting runtimes and massive abstraction layers for a 3-match puzzle game. You don't have to make players wait to download dozens of megabytes for small-to-midscale games made with Unity or Godot. While watching people brag about rendering 10-15k bullets using crazy optimizations and C++ plugins in certain engines, here, a "magazine" of at least 70k-80k bullets is waiting for you. 

On the other hand, this framework (and even Nim itself) has such a low learning curve that you won't even think like you're choosing it instead of your current engines and languages. You can easily fit all of this right alongside what you already have.


## Getting Started
Install kirpi easily with `nimble install kirpi`.

To compile a Kirpi project for your desktop platform, the Nim toolchain and compiler are sufficient. The command `nim c -r game.nim` will do the job. 

```nim
#game.nim
import kirpi

var sampleText:Text

proc load() =
    sampleText=newText("Hello World!",getDefaultFont())

proc update(dt: float) =
    if isKeyPressed(KeyboardKey.Escape):
        quit()

proc draw() =
    clear(Black)
    setColor(White)
    draw(sampleText,100,100)

run( "sample game",load,update,draw)

```

However, for smooth builds across all supported platforms and an ideal folder structure, we recommend using the [kirpi_app_template](https://github.com/erayzesen/kirpi_app_template) repository. This repo also includes extensively customized compiler configuration files, thanks in part to the Naylib community, which automate nearly everything for Android builds. Additionally, we provide customized Emscripten configurations for Web builds. In short, you can deploy your project to Android with just a few commands, and to other platforms with a single command. Detailed build instructions are available in our template repository.

## Documentation
The examples repo is [here](https://github.com/erayzesen/kirpi-examples).

Kirpi doesn’t have fancy tutorials yet. But honestly, the entire API is basically the cheatsheet below. We weren’t joking about the simplicity of the API.

## Contributing
To contribute code to the project, please try to follow Nim’s standard library [style guide](https://nim-lang.org/docs/nep1.html). We generally strive to maintain consistency with it throughout this project.(You might not like this guide, but after all, it’s a prepared style guide that everyone can access and use collectively.)
### Core principles
* ***Do not use macros or metaprogramming.*** This project does not need them and should not rely on them. It is important that the framework and its internal code remain understandable with zero learning curve, using only basic Nim knowledge.
* ***Avoid unnecessary abstractions.*** Prefer primitive types in API method arguments (e.g. float, int, bool). Only group values using tuple when grouping is actually meaningful. Use seq or array for collections. For example, defining a vertex format explicitly as ```tuple[x, y, u, v: float]``` is preferred over introducing custom types like ```Vertex2D```. The intent is for an intermediate Nim developer to understand the expected data layout immediately using Nim language knowledge alone, without learning framework-specific types or relying on detailed API documentation.
* ***Preserve minimalism.*** We aim to keep the API small and stable, and to avoid expanding or changing it unless it is truly necessary. Suggestions are always welcome, but please don’t take offense if an idea is declined. If what you are building can live as a separate module, plugin, or library in an external repository, prefer that approach. This framework is intentionally designed as a small core API meant to be surrounded by an ecosystem of extensions. If you believe a missing capability in the core API genuinely prevents this, then open a PR and let’s discuss it.
* ***Treat the backend as a replaceable layer.*** This project currently uses Naylib (Nim’s Raylib wrapper) as its backend. However, if you inspect the source code, you’ll see that Raylib is used at an arm’s length, making it entirely feasible to add alternative backends alongside it. The graphics API is largely built on top of Raylib’s rlgl layer and its OpenGL-oriented calls. Because of this, ideas or experiments around different backends are very welcome. As long as the approach remains pragmatic, the backend layer is intentionally the most flexible part of this project.  

### Other ways to contribute

* Write and share plugins or modules that are either fully dependent on the framework or can be used independently while working well with it (ECS, physics, GUI, etc.)
* Open issues to report bugs or missing features.
* Create tutorials or documentation related to the framework.
* If you enjoy **kirpi**, share your thoughts on social media to help others discover it :) Don’t forget to share your work(game, prototype, creative coding projects ) with the `#madewithkirpi` tag.

## What's mean kirpi?
"Hedgehog” in my native language Turkish is “kirpi.”  Its pronunciation is /keer-pee/.
